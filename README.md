# GHTabSize

I like four spaces. You might like two. GitHub uses eight. GHTabSize is a Chrome extension that changes the `tab-size` property based on your preferences. It has a setting for each syntax mode; you can use two spaces for CoffeeScript and four for C, and they won't conflict.

## Known issues

- It only runs on page load. Clicking on a file from a directory listing doesn't reload the page, so right know you have to hit refresh. This will be fixed soon.
- There really needs to be a settings page. Working on it.
